   [Day5.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day5.cpp)

6. Day 6 Question: Given an unsorted array of N integers, find smallest and largest element in optimal way.
   [Day6.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day6.cpp)

7. Day 7 Question: Rotate the array to the left N times. Accept N value from the user.
   [Day7.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day7.cpp)

8. Day 8 Question: Check if two strings are anagrams of each other or not.
   [Day8.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day8.cpp)

9. Day 9 Question: Reverse a string using recursion.
   [Day9.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day9.cpp)

10. Day 10 Question: Given a string, find the first non-repeated character in it. If no such character exists, return a specific value (e.g., a special character or -1) to indicate that no non-repeated character is found.
   [Day10.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day10.cpp)

11. Day 11 Question: You are given a string S, the task is to reverse the string word by word.
   [Day11.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day11.cpp)

12. Day 12 Question: You're given a string S,  consisting of "{", "}", "(", ")", "[" and "]". Return true is S is balanced, else return false.
   [Day12.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day12.cpp)

13. Day 13 Question: Given a Roman numeral, the task is to find its corresponding decimal value.
   [Day13.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day13.cpp)

14. Day 14 Question: Given a string of lowercase alphabets, count all possible substrings (not necessarily distinct) that has exactly k distinct characters.
   [Day14.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day14.cpp)

15. Day 15 Question: Check whether two string are isomorphic.
Note: Two strings are isomorphic if one-to-one mapping is possible for every character of first string to every character of second string while preserving the orders of the characters.
   [Day15.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day15.cpp)

16. Day 16 Question: Find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 2 integers. The GCD of any 2 numbers is the largest number that divides both the integers.
   [Day16.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day16.cpp)

17. Day 17 Question: Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of the fibonacci series or not. Return true if the number of members of the fibonacci series else false.
   [Day17.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day17.cpp)

18. Day 18 Question: You are given two positive numbers N and M. You have to return the Nth root of M. If the Nth root of M is not an integer, return -1.
   [Day18.cpp](https://github.com/Shreeyash01/WS-ProgrammingChallenge/blob/main/Day18.cpp)
